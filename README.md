# Movie_Data_Base
I did small project-practice about reading and filtering datas from movie data base file.
The idea was to fetch datas and create a table with its data: #movie-rank #movie-title
I made an input-filter to filter enetered word to see if it matches with any movie from ddata-base;
Didn't put much effort to styling the document, because I was more focused on the JS logic
